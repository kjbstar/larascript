# Packages

Have Larascript prompt before loading for each package.

## Package Files

Add one package per file, to the packages folder. Name the file using the package name, ending with a `.sh`. Separate words with an underscore. Optionally add other references. For example, `Way_Generators_dev.sh`. This will prompt with "Add Way Generators dev package?".

## Package File Code

All script-wide variables from larascript.sh will be available to each package file.

See included package files for more details.
