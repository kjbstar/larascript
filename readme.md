# Larascript

Work in progress. Change to meet your needs.


### Usage

Assuming Larascript is saved to /Sites/Projects/larascripts and your new local website will be located in /Sites, run the following.

cd /Sites
Projects/larascripts/larascripts.sh

Then, answer the questions.


### Assumptions

- Familiar with Mac/Linux command line.
- laravel.phar is installed and added to path.
- gsed is installed - brew install gnu-sed.
- php cli version is installed and working.


### Disclaimer / Warranty

These scripts works well on my Mac workstations. Perhaps you are using a different OS version or have a different configuration. Use at your own risk. There is no warranty. Command line scripts can break your shit. Be careful. :)
